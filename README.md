# 🟢 Beginner Level

## 1. Arrays

**When to use**

- collection of ordered data
- indexing matters
- contiguous memory

**Common patterns**

- iteration
- two pointers (intro)
- prefix sum

**Example problems**

- Find max element
- Reverse array
- Remove duplicates

### Python Example

```python
def find_max(arr):
    return max(arr)

```

### Java Example

```java
intfindMax(int[] arr) {
intmax= arr[0];
for (int n : arr)if (n > max) max = n;
return max;
}

```

### JavaScript Example

```jsx
functionfindMax(arr) {
returnMath.max(...arr);
}

```

### C Example

```c
intfindMax(int arr[],int n) {
int max = arr[0];
for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
if(arr[i]>max) max = arr[i];
return max;
}

```

## 2. Strings

**When to use**

- text manipulation
- pattern matching

**Patterns**

- frequency counting
- two-pointer substrings
- palindrome checks

---

# 🟡 Intermediate Level

## 1. Sliding Window

**Use when**

- substring / subarray with condition
- “longest”, “shortest”, “count of”

**Idea**

- expand right pointer
- shrink left pointer

---

## 2. Linked Lists

**Use when**

- frequent insert/delete
- sequential memory not required

---

# 🔴 Advanced Level

## 1. Dynamic Programming

**Use when**

- “maximum/minimum number of ways”
- overlapping subproblems
- optimal substructure

**Techniques**

- top-down memoization
- bottom-up tabulation
